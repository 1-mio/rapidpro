<a href="https://rapidprodev.slack.com/messages/development/">Slack</a> room. You should not
use this room unless you are a developer. If you require support, please contact
your hosting provider.

## Trello - Development Roadmap

You can view the current development roadmap for RapidPro on the public
<a href="https://trello.com/b/fEQRLBDV/rapidpro">Trello</a> board. Please only
add comments or vote on cards that you have opinions on.

## GitHub - Bug Reports & Feature Requests

If you have a bug report on existing functionality on RapidPro, we first
recommend you contact your provider to make sure it isn't either an
operational issue or a misunderstanding in functionality.

Once you have confirmation that it is indeed a bug or functionality that
does not yet exist, you can create a new
issue on <a href="https://github.com/rapidpro/rapidpro/issues">Github</a>. Note
that you should **NOT** open issues unless you have verified with your
provider that the behavior is indeed valid. Bugs opened without clear
steps to reproduce them will be closed.
