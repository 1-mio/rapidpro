# Documentation

This documentation aims to provide a high level overview of the architecture
of RapidPro. The goal is to give contributors enough to understand the layout
of code in the repository, understand the various components in a RapidPro
installation and glean some insight into the approach used.

## Deployment

The deployment section of this documentation provides a high level overview of
how RapidPro is generally hosted, as well as instructions on how to run your
own local instance of RapidPro for development.

## Packages

The packages section provides a high level overview of the primary packages used
within RapidPro. We do not aim to document every detail of functionality in the
codebase here, but these pages can act as a sort of roadmap and overview of the
main models used within RapidPro.

With an understanding of these models you will have a high level understanding
of the architecture of the system.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Note that RapidPro is primarily built as a SaaS platform, as such, its primary
goals are to provide value to customers. As the harsh reality of customer
requirements meet real life constraints, various parts of the system have grown
organically and continue to do so. In short, some pieces of RapidPro are ugly,
but what it may lack in beauty in makes up in real world testing and in
functionality. As we continue to build and enhance RapidPro we continue to
refactor various pieces in order to address the needs of both our customers
and coders.</p>
