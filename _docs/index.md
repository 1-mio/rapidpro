# Documentation

This documentation aims to provide a high level overview of the architecture
of RapidPro. The goal is to give contributors enough to understand the layout
of code in the repository, understand the various components in a RapidPro
installation and glean some insight into the approach used.

<div class="note">
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Note that RapidPro is primarily built as a SaaS platform, as such, its primary
goals are to provide value to customers. As the harsh reality of customer
requirements meet real life constraints, various parts of the system have grown
organically and continue to do so. In short, some pieces of RapidPro are ugly,
but what it may lack in beauty in makes up in real world testing and in
functionality. As we continue to build and enhance RapidPro we continue to
refactor various pieces in order to address the needs of both our customers
and coders.
